# Finance App

## Summary

This is a finance app made with `node.js`, tested with `jest` and built with `parcel`. No other libraries are involved in the making of this app. The app is mainly a learning process for myself on making apps without the need of react, vue, angular or any other front-end frameworks.

The primary goal of the app is to provide a clean interface to manage budgets and finances. Many college students like myself have trouble with managing their own money, so this app aims to help that issue by providing a 'one-stop shop' for all of your finances.

## Journals

For learning and future reference I will attempt to document the creation and thinking process behind the making of this app. Please refer to the wiki page for the journal entries.
